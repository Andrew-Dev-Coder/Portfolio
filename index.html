        <h1>Andrew Nicholson</h1>
        <p>
            I am an aspiring full-stack developer, currently studying studying Computer Science and BETC IT.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is currently my frontend flagship project, but will be replaced by my coursework for BETC IT shortly.
            <br>
            This website will undergo changes as my personal skills develop.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have experience using Github, Visual Studio code, and Andriod Studio.
            <br>
            Links to all my profiles can be found at the bottom of the page.
        </p>
        <p>
            My current main focus is learning Kotlin through Google's <em>Andriod Basics with Compose</em> course as apart of the Google Developer program.
