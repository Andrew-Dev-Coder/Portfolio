    <h2>Developing Summary</h2>
    <p>
        This website was developed for my transiton task for BTEC IT from Year 11 to Year 12.
        This was also my first developing a project for a client.
        The current version of the site is not accesible or responsive, I have plans to change this soon.

        <h2>Planning</h2>
        <p>
            I started by coming up a colorless design.
            Once the client was happy with that, I then came up with a design that had color.

        <h2>Developing</h2>
        <p>
            When I made the current version of the website I had very little knowdegle of HTML, and so did the FutureLearn: <em>A Beginner’s Guide to Web Development with HTML5</em> alongside.
            Looking back, I should have completed the course before beginning to write the code.

    <p>
        I plan to refractor the website, so that it is accesible and responsive.
