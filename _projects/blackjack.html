        <h2>Planning</h2>
        <p>
            For this project, I started by planning out the basic features of Blackjack, which is shown in this text file on <a href="https://github.com/Andrew-Dev-Coder/Blackjack/blob/main/Process.txt">GitHub</a>.
            I then made a flowchart to help me visualize what order the program would have to run in, this flowchart can be found on <a href="https://github.com/Andrew-Dev-Coder/Blackjack/blob/main/Blackjack%20Flowchart.pdf">GitHub</a>

        <h2>Testing</h2>
        <p>
            I tested whenever I made new functions, I tested them individually and with the rest of the code at that point.
            If there was an issue which caused the code to have a logic or syntax error I would then look through the code to see if I could spot the issue, but if I was unable to do this I would then use debugging with breakpoints to identify where the issue came from.
            Once I believed I had completed the code, I did final tests and then got some of friends to also test the code (beta testing).
