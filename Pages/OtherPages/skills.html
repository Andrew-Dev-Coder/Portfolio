                <h3>How I strucutre Projects</h3>
                <h4>Projects</h4>
                <p>
                    When I come with an idea for a new project that I want to or need to develop the first thing I do is think of a basic outline for how the final version will work.
                    This is done in bullet points. 
                    I then think about what the code will need to do in order to achieve the final goal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is showen in my blackjack project which can be found <!--<a href="">here</a> and (add later after project is on projects page)--> on GitHub, <a href="https://github.com/Andrew-Dev-Coder/Blackjack">here</a>.
                    I started by outlineling what is needed for a game of blackjack, I then came up with what the functions would need to do.
                    At the time of this project I used a text document to plan, but now use GitHub issues as shown by the development of this website.
                </p>
                <h4>GitHub Projects</h4>
                <p>
                    I now use GitHub projects and issues in order to track the progress and note down ideas for a project, such as this website.
                    I use issues to break down my ideas into smaller more mangable chunks (abstraction).
                    I use GitHub projects to track the progress of the issues, not just when I am planning but due in development and maintaince.
                    I link branches to issues so that it is clear when I am fixing an issue.

                <p>
                    I aim to describe commits in one or two sentences.
                    I commit before I haive a break from coding, I like to keep commits to one file at a time.

                    I have used GitHub pages to deloply and host, websites and webpages, such as this website.

                <p>
                    Version control systems help software engineers because when used correctly they allow teams to rollback versions if there is an issue and do not blindly allow others to add to a project without be reviewed by a person.
