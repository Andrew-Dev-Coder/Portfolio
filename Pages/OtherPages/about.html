                    I had a small interest in electronic circuits but had only done a little bit of block coding using
                    Scratch.

                    <p>
                        This was the first time i was introduced to programming fully, by this time I was not using Scratch
                        but had forgotten most of it.
                        Due to my special neededs I was placed in a special needs class for creatives, due to this I did very little coding and when we did it was using tykiner block coding.

                    <p>
                        My school started GCSEs in year 9. My school made everyone do a langauge, and history or Geography which left me with two options to freely pick from.
                        I was certain on doing History and Geography which left with one choice, seeing as I had my interest in electronic circuits I choose to do Computer Science as my other option.
                        Once the Computer Science course has started I was a fair bit behind the rest of the class but I did replit's course on an introduction to programming with Python, this helped me to catch up with everyone else, by Christmas I was one of the best in the class.
                        I did not end up completeing the replit course but in lessons we were doing Python work anyway so once I had caught up, I was able to do the challenges set by my teachers well.

                    <p>
                        We carried on to do Python work all the way through year 10.

                    <p>
                        Towards the end of year 10 and the start of year 11, is when we started the theory side of Computer Science.
                        We still did regular coding alongside the theory.

                I am planning to go to university after Sixth Form.
                After university, I plan to get a job in the computer industry as a full-stack software engineer.
